# Instacart Basket Analysis - Python

Data Analytics Project by Javier Sanchez Agesta

## Objective

This folder contains the work done through the Python project of my Data Analytics course. In this project we worked with The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017, accessed on December 2021.

Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app, and they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. My task is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation.

Through the project we will try to find out which ones are the busiest days and times, when customers spend the most, what are the most popular products, find better ways of grouping similar products and, very importantly, we want to know the behaviour habits of the different kind of customers (by age, by region, by loyalty...)

## Data

The data set contains information about the following attributes: 

•	Orders

•	Products

•	Departments

The full details of the data are available [here](https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017)

## Tools 

For this project the following Python libraries were used:

•	Pandas- for data analysis

•	Seaborn-for visualization

## Folders contents

The code is available as jupyter notebooks, available in the different subfolders:

- Analysis: part dedicated to exercises where we find out answers to the business questions

- Importing & Exporting data: coding on how to import and export data in different formats

- Making data consistent: different consistency checks and techniques for cleaning and wrangling data

- Making groups, new Variables and Data Visualization: Coding for combining data sets, creating new variables from those combinations and some introductory data visualization

- Cleaned and Wrangled Data: CSV files after cleaning and wrangling original data with Python
