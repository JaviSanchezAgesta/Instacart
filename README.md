# Instacart Basket Analysis - Python

Data Analytics Project by Javier Sanchez Agesta

## Objective

This folder contains the work done through the Python project of my Data Analytics course. In this project we worked with The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017, accessed on December 2021.

Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app, and they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. My task is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation.

Through the project we will try to find out which ones are the busiest days and times, when customers spend the most, what are the most popular products, find better ways of grouping similar products and, very importantly, we want to know the behaviour habits of the different kind of customers (by age, by region, by loyalty...)

## Data

The data set contains information about the following attributes: 

•	Orders

•	Products

•	Departments

The full details of the data are available [here](https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017)

## Tools 

For this project the following Python libraries were used:

•	Pandas- for data analysis

•	Seaborn-for visualization

## Folders contents

The code is available as jupyter notebooks, available in the different subfolders:

- I. Project Management: Data Project brief document containing information and descriptions of main aspects of our analysis, such as 'Objective', 'Context', 'Key questions', 'Stakeholders', 'Data sources', 'Analysis criteria', 'Terminology' and 'Project deliverables'

- II. Scripts: this folder contains the Jupyter notebooks created for this analysis, including cleaning and wrangling the data, consistency checks,  subsetting and creating new variables, and data visualization.

- III. Analysis - Visualizations: in this folder we can find the main visualizations produced through the analysis with Seaborn and maplotlib. Includes line, bar and pie charts. 

- IV. Sent to client: Excel file containing the report ready to be sent to our client. In it we can find a step by step guide for our analysis, including the population flow of our data, description on the wrangling and cleaning performed tasks, visualizations with explanations and the final recommendations.

- Cleaned and Wrangled Data: CSV & pkl files resulted after cleaning and wrangling original data with Python.
